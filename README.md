# 📡 Tech & Engineering Talent Radar v4

**SCTP Group 6** — Strategic Intelligence for Singapore's Tech & Engineering Sectors

## Overview

A Streamlit dashboard that provides **B2B market intelligence** for CTOs, investors, and recruiters. We don't just tell you who is hiring — we tell you **how much it costs** and **how hard it is to hire**.

### The Core Insight

In IT and Engineering, the **skill is in the title**:
- ❌ Vague: "Sales Manager" (what do they sell?)
- ✅ Specific: "Senior Python Developer", "Civil Engineer (Tunnelling)", "AWS Cloud Architect"

By applying **regex pattern matching** on job titles, we extract 11 tech stack categories — bypassing the missing job description limitation.

### What's New in v4: The Talent Scarcity Index

Previous versions showed **Cost** (salary). v4 adds **Feasibility** (application counts) — answering the most important hiring question: *"How hard and expensive is it to fill this role?"*

## Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | What It Shows | Business Question |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| 💰 **Salary (Price)** | Box plot of salary distributions by tech stack | "What does this talent cost?" |
| 📈 **Demand (Volume)** | Hiring trends over time by tech stack | "Is demand growing or shrinking?" |
| ⚠️ **Scarcity (Supply)** | Avg applicants per role — color-coded heatmap | "How hard is it to find this talent?" |
| 🎯 **The Quadrant (Strategy)** | Cost vs. Difficulty bubble chart | "Where should I invest my hiring budget?" |

### The "Quadrant of Pain"

The killer feature — a scatter plot mapping **Salary (Cost)** vs **Applicants (Ease of Hire)**:

- **Bottom Right (High Pay, Low Apps):** 🔴 "Danger Zone" — Hardest to hire, most expensive. Action: Headhunt.
- **Top Left (Low Pay, High Apps):** 🟢 "Value Zone" — Easy to find, affordable. Action: Post ads.
- **Bottom Left (Low Pay, Low Apps):** ⚠️ Niche roles with supply issues.
- **Top Right (High Pay, High Apps):** 💰 Premium roles with healthy supply.

## Tech Stack Categories

| Stack | Keywords Matched |
|-------|-----------------|
| Python | `python` |
| Java | `java` |
| React/JS | `react`, `node`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `vue`, `angular` |
| Cloud/AWS | `aws`, `azure`, `cloud`, `gcp`, `google cloud` |
| Data/AI | `data`, `ai`, `machine learning`, `nlp`, `torch`, `tensorflow`, `bi`, `tableau` |
| Cybersecurity | `cyber`, `security`, `infosec` |
| DevOps | `devops`, `sre`, `ci/cd`, `kubernetes`, `docker`, `jenkins` |
| .NET/C# | `.net`, `c#`, `dotnet` |
| Civil/Struct | `civil`, `structural`, `tunnel`, `bridge`, `geotechnical` |
| Mechanical | `mechanical`, `hvac`, `piping`, `m&e` |
| Electrical | `electrical`, `power`, `switchgear` |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
```

### Step 1: Process Your Data

Place your raw CSV (1M+ rows) in this folder, rename to `tech_talent_radar.csv`, then run:

```bash
python data_processor_v4.py
```

This will:
1. Parse the JSON `categories` column
2. Filter for **IT & Engineering** rows only
3. Rename columns to standard names
4. Tag each job with a **Tech Stack** via regex
5. Extract **application counts** (`metadata_totalNumberJobApplication` → `num_applications`)
6. Clean salary data
7. Output `tech_talent_radar_final_v4.zip`

### Step 2: Run the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Raw Dataset Column Mapping

| Raw Column | Mapped To | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `title` | `job_title` | Job title string |
| `categories` | `category` | JSON → "Information Technology" or "Engineering" |
| `postedCompany_name` | `company` | Company name |
| `salary_minimum` | `salary_min` | Monthly salary floor |
| `salary_maximum` | `salary_max` | Monthly salary ceiling |
| `average_salary` | `salary_avg` | Computed average |
| `metadata_newPostingDate` | `date` | Posting date |
| `metadata_totalNumberJobApplication` | `num_applications` | **NEW in v4** — applicant count per role |

## Project Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Streamlit dashboard v4 (4 strategic tabs) |
| `data_processor_v4.py` | Raw CSV → optimized ZIP pipeline (with application counts) |
| `app_recommender.py` | AI job recommender (separate B2C tool — see below) |
| `tech_talent_radar_final_v4.zip` | Processed data (generated by processor) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

### About the Data File

The raw dataset (`tech_talent_radar.csv`, ~256MB, 1M+ rows) is too large for GitHub. To run locally:
1. Obtain the raw CSV from your team's shared drive `SGJobData.csv`
2. Rename to `tech_talent_radar.csv`, hit F2 with the file selected from Windows subsystems
3. Run `python data_processor_v4.py` to generate the ZIP
4. The processed `tech_talent_radar_final_v4.zip` is committed to the repo when available

### About `app_recommender.py`

This is a **separate B2C tool** (job seeker facing) that provides AI-powered job recommendations with skill gap analysis. It requires:
- `backend/recommendation_engine.py` (not included)
- `SGJobData.csv` dataset

To run: `streamlit run app_recommender.py`

It is intentionally **not merged** into the main dashboard — see Architecture Decision below.

## Architecture Decision: Why Not Merge the Recommender?

The `app_recommender.py` is a **B2C Job Recommender** (for job seekers). The main dashboard is a **B2B Market Intelligence Tool** (for CTOs & investors). Merging them would dilute the value proposition.

Instead, we **extracted the key insight** from the recommender — application count data — and built the **Talent Scarcity Index**, which serves the B2B audience far better.

## Methodology

1. **Filter:** IT & Engineering categories (parsed from JSON)
2. **Extract:** Regex scan titles for 11 tech stack patterns
3. **Enrich:** Application counts as a proxy for talent supply
4. **Analyze:** Salary × Scarcity quadrant analysis
5. **Visualize:** Interactive Plotly charts in Streamlit

## Business Questions Answered

- **For CTOs:** "Should I build a Python team or a Java team? Which is cheaper AND easier to staff?"
- **For Investors:** "Which tech sectors have talent bottlenecks that could slow company growth?"
- **For Recruiters:** "Where should I focus sourcing efforts — which roles are hardest to fill?"
- **For Strategists:** "What's the cost-difficulty tradeoff for each technology?"
